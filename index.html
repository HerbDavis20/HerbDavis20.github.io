        - The <p> tag defines a paragraph
        - Tags appear as an opening <div> and closing </div> pair

        Week 3: Festival of Economics Data
    </h2>
    <p>
        One argument that I found interesting from the festival of economics was the extent of spacial disparity in the
        labour markets across England.

<h3>
    <figure id="Location7" style="width: 100%; height: 500px;"></figure>

    <figure id="Location8" style="width: 100%; height: 300px;"></figure>
</h3>
    <p>
        From these charts it's clear to see that the majority of the wealth and skilled labour collects in the south of
        engalnd and is particularly high in areas in London, proving that there is a high level of spacial disparity in
        the labour markets in England.

    <p>
        Here I have changed the title and subtitle to be more descriptive of the chart. I have also added a 30 day
        moving average to make it easier to see the overall trend in the chart. I have also made the X-axis labels more
        clear.

   <h3>
    <figure id="Location10"></figure>

   </h3>
    <p>
        This chart shows the 9 countries with the largest population in the world. I chose Wikipedia as typically tables
        in wikipedia are directly in the HTML file as tables rather than being written in java and included in the HTML
        file. This allowed me to use the pd.read_HTML function in python.
