        Evaluating Bitcoin: The Transition Towards Financial Legitimacy
    </h2>

    <h3>
        Aims: <br>
        This project aims to provide an insight into how the perception of Bitcoin has changed as an asset over time.
        From Bitcoin's
        inception in 2009, there has been drastic changes in the way people view Bitcoin. In it's early years,
        traditional investors had significant reservations on the validity of Bitcoin due to its erratic price
        volatility and domination in dark web transactions. Now, Bitcoin is a common asset among some of the largest
        funds and asset managers, this year being the first time a Bitcoin spot ETF has been approved by the U.S.
        Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC).<br><br>


        Through this project I aim to take a data driven approach using multiple metrics and statistical methods to
        reveal the changes in the fundamental value of Bitcoin, to both institutional and retail investors.

    <h3>
        To begin with, I looked at a broader view of the historic price movements of the VIX volatility index and the
        price of Bitcoin to discover any prominent trends in the data. The data for this chart comes from the FRED API
        and is
        embedded directily into the vega spec to allow it to remain live and update daily with the data. <br><br>

        The VIX volatility index is derived from combining weighted prices of the S&P500 put and call option prices for
        the next 30 days. It predicts the likely range of movement in US eqity markets and is often regarded as the
        'fear'
        index. The VIX represents a good indication of the current equity market sentiment. <br><br>

        I thought this would be a useful comparison to make as conventionally, during times of high market
        volatility, investors move from stocks into 'safe haven' assets like gold or U.S. Treasury bonds to mitigate
        risk. If there is a similar trend developing with Bitcoin, it shows that investors are beginning to view it as
        more
        of a valid and valuable asset from what it once was.

    </p>

    <h3>
        Next I looked into how the price of Bitcoin reacts to spikes in the VIX index over different lengths of time.
        In the 30 day period after a spike there is a tendancy for significant, greater than 10% increases in price,
        however
        in large
        there is no clear trend in price increases vs decreases here.

    <h3>
        Now, to investigate individual price evolutions of Bitcoin after spikes in the VIX index to determine if
        Bitcoin is continuing to act as a risk-on asset, or evolving towards risk-off, I made the
        volatility spike points interactive to show the following 30 days of bitcoin price movement. <br><br>

        I sourced the data for this chart using the yfinance python library to retrive data from Yahoo Finance, working
        similarly to an API since the Yahoo Finance API has been discontinued.

    </p>

    <H3>
        Next I compared correlation between Bitcoin and gold, a classic risk-off asset, with the correlation between
        Bitcoin and the VIX index. Where positive, both variable's value is moving in the same direction. Where the
        price of bitcoin and gold are moving in the same direction, it is suggestive of bitcoin acting as hedge against
        volatility. <br><br>

        The data cleaining and calculation of the rolling correlation was done in pandas using the rolling_corr
        function.

    <h2>
        Challenges:
    </h2>

    <h3>
        As most of my data used in this project is daily price data, the majority of the challenges I came across were
        in cleaning and manupulating the data in python to extract as much information from it as possible. In
        particular, working with dates caused many issues due to the different formats that dates come in. To resolve
        this, I began to use pd.to_datetime function on all dates before beginning my analysis as this would prevent
        issues later.
        <br><br>
        Another issue I came across was finding live price data. Many of the API's that are available were behind
        paywalls and only allowed minimal data to be extracted for free. The FRED API works well and is easy to use
        however lacks a lot of key data for my project. I discovered the yfinance package late into my project but this
        was an effective tool in sourcing live financial data.
        <br><br>
        Another challenge I came across was values in the dataset not being stored as numbers so when it came to working
        with the data I was getting a lot of NaN outputs. To solve this I made sure to convert all the data into floats
        or integers
        using .astype(float)
        <br><br>
        When filtering values out of a dataframe, I also learnt the importance of resetting the index back to zero to
        prevent issues when merging dataframes later on. During my analysis in python, with so many stages of filtering
        and calculations, I found it useful to make new dataframes for different stages of anaylsis, rather than
        continue updataing the same dataframe. This was better for experimentation and made errors easier to find and
        resolve.

    <h2>
        Conclusion:
    </h2>
    <h3>
        **This is contradictory because the VIX typically reflects risk aversion, while gold reflects a hedge against
        risk. Bitcoin cannot be perfectly aligned with both risk-on (high VIX) and risk-off (gold) behaviors
        simultaneously without undermining its singular market narrative.**
