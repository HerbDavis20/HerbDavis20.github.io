        How Is the Perception of Bitcoin as a Store of Wealth Changing Over Time?

    <h3>
        Aims: <br>
        This project aims to provide an insight into how the perception of Bitcoin has changed as an asset over time.
        From Bitcoin's
        inception in 2009, there have been drastic changes in the way people view Bitcoin. In it's early years,
        traditional investors had significant reservations on the validity of Bitcoin due to its erattic price
        volatility and domination in dark web transactions. Now, Bitcoin is a common asset among some of the largest
        funds and asset managers, and this year the first Bitcoin spot ETF was approved by the U.S. Securities and
        Exchange Commision (SEC).<br><br>


        Through this project I aim to take a data driven approach using multiple metrics and statistical methods to
        reveal the changes in the fundamental value of Bitcoin, both to institutional and retail investors.
