        Aims:

    <h3>
        <br>
        This project aims to provide an insight into how the perception of Bitcoin has changed over time.
        In it's early years,
        traditional investors had significant reservations on the validity of Bitcoin due to its erratic price
        volatility and domination in dark web transactions. Now, Bitcoin is a common asset among some of the largest
        funds and asset managers.<br><br>


        Through this project I aim to take a data driven approach, using multiple metrics and statistical methods to
        reveal the changes in the fundamental value of Bitcoin, to both institutional and retail investors.

    <h3>
        I thought comparing bitcoin and the VIX would be insightful as high market
        volatility often pushes investors to move from stocks into 'safe haven' assets like gold or U.S. Treasury bonds.
        If there is a similar trend with Bitcoin, it implies a shift in bitcoins perception.

        <H3>
            I compared the correlation with gold (a typical volatility hedge) and the VIX. When positively correlated
            with gold it suggests bitcoin is acting as hedge
            against volatility. A negative correlation with the VIX implies the same effect.
            <br>

            <h2>Data:</h2>
            <h3>

                The Bitcoin data for this chart came from the FRED API, however I was struggling to find a free API that
                could
                source historic gold price data before I discovered the yfinance package. Instead, I used a downloaded
                CSV
                file from <a
                    href="https://auronum.co.uk/gold-price-news/historic-gold-price-data/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"
                    target="_blank">Auronum </a> <br><br>


                The bitcoin data contained a lot of null values that had to be filtered out.
                I could then merge the bitcoin and gold price dataframes together by data
                using
                how='inner' to keep only the common values. Then using the rolling_corr fuction I could calculate the
                correlation values.
                <br><br><br><br><br>

        <h3>
            Exploring this correlation further, grouping by year, I calculated the average yearly r-values to highlight
            the
            broader trend in
            the data.
            <br><br>

            It is evident that there is an increasingly positive correlation between bitcoin and gold
            showing bitcoin's sentiment is increasingly risk-off, also highlighted by the increasingly negative VIX and
            bitcoin correlation.

            Challenges:
        </h2>

        <h3>
            Knowing how to filter and sort data to make creating a complex chart in vega more efficint I found to be
            particularly hard and took a lot of trial and error. Making sure the data was in long form was a good
            starting point to solve this.
            <br><br>

            Working with dates caused many issues due to the different formats. To resolve
            this, I standardised all my timeseries data using pd.to_datetime function on all timeseries data before my
            analysis.

            <br><br>
            Another issue I came across was finding live price data. Many of the API's that are available were behind
            paywalls and only allowed minimal data to be extracted for free. I discovered the yfinance package late into
            my project but
            this
            was an effective tool in sourcing live financial data.
            <br><br>
            Another challenge I faced was incorectly formatted numbers, causing NaN outputs when analyising. To solve
            this I made sure to convert all the data into
            floats
            or integers
            using .astype(float)
            <br><br>
            When filtering data in pandas, I learnt to reset the index to prevent merging issues. Creating seperate
            dataframes at each stage I also found to make experimenting and finding errors more efficient.


        </h3>
        <br>
        <h2>
            Conclusion:
        </h2>
        <h3>
            My analysis supports the evolving perception of Bitcoin, moving from a highly speculative asset to an
            increasingly stable asset, more traditionally aligned with 'safe haven'assets that investors flock to during
            times of high market turbulence. Looking into bitcoin's correlation with other traditional assets and the
            VIX index showed bitcoin increasingly behaving like a risk-off asset, where in its early days it was nothing
            but a speculative bubble. before 2018 where both correlations are negative suggests a contradiction in
            bitcoins sentiment. More recently there is a clear divide in the two correlations which shows that bitcoin's
            perception is consolidating. There is still a way to go for bitcoin however, as
            when comparing the risk/reward
            with gold, it is clear to see such variance at times cannot be associated with a low risk asset.
            Furthermore,
            in times of deep market stress, investors are looking for assets with intrinsic value, not just a
            speculation fuelled asset. It can be argued
            that bitcoin does not have these characteristics such as dividends and cash flow that other more classical
            assets have.
